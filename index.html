  <h1>Adding CSS style and HTML Structure</h1>

  <h2>Creating a Structured Document</h2>
  <div class="concept">
<p>Developer tools allow on web pages allow you to see the elements in rectangles.
You can also read the same text that is on the page
Page structure is like tree branches each has an opening tag and closing tag

HTML and CSS are both "languages" HTML controls the "structure" of a web page CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks). When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.
  All the elements on a webpage are contained in a box with its own style.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>CSS Style</h2>
</div>
  
  <div class="concept">
  
  <p>CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>. The "C" is by far the most important part of this phrase. 
"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.</p>

  <h3>HTML Sizing guide</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="concept">
    <p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
    Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.

    There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
        Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.
        Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. 

    Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</p>
  </div>
<div class="concept">
<p>Box Positioning

    Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
    Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
  <h4> Avoiding Repetition</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="concept">
  <p>Repetition of code while programming will have you doing double the work and increasing the risk of errors. Assigning a specific class Div when creating certain elements within your HTML code will help you adjust a attribute that is assign to that div. Every element that is associated with that div will be affected in the same way making the creation process more streamlined and efficient.</p>
